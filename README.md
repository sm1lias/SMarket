# SMarket
A university project where we asked to create an Android application of supermarkets, 
where consumers can see the price of a product in all imported supermarkets and add to their cart,
search in the database for a specific item and to make the order. Also their is sign in function for the stuff.

We use Firebase database, local sqlite database, fragments, Firebase email authentication and our app support multi-languages.
