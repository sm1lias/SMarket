# SMarket
A university project where we created an Android application, where consumers can search for a product in some supermarkets, add to cart and make an order. Also, administrators can manage the online database from inside the application.

We used Firebase database, local sqlite database, fragments, Firebase email authentication and our app support multi-languages.
